# SapClarify

**SapClarify** is an intent-aware, purpose-driven execution language designed for secure and transparent system control.

Unlike conventional scripting or automation languages, SapClarify is not built around command sequencing — it's built around **command interpretation**. Every action issued by a user, whether textual, logical, or voiced, is parsed through a deterministic understanding framework that maps intent to secure, trackable system behavior.

## Core Philosophy

> “A command is not an order — it is a clarification of what the user wishes to see done.”

SapClarify treats every user instruction as a **semantic path node** within a larger logic tree. Its runtime does not execute blindly, but walks the path from declared intent to executable consequence with full auditability.

---

## Key Features (Design Goals)

- **Interpretive Runtime**: Executes via a real-time interpreter to ensure transparency and traceability.
- **Purpose-Binding Execution**: All commands are tagged with declared intent and scope.
- **Zero Side Effects**: All non-pure actions must be sandboxed or explicitly confirmed.
- **Audit-First Logic**: Every action is logged at source, resolution, and completion stages.
- **AI-Compatible Parsing**: Supports LLM-assisted disambiguation and mapping from natural language to intent trees.

## Use Cases

- Secure application launch
- Controlled memory access
- Intent-based automation in OS-level workflows
- LLM/Agent instruction translation layer
- Traceable AI-augmented system interfaces

---

## Compatibility

SapClarify is designed to be embedded in next-generation operating systems such as **TreeOS**, and to interoperate with low-level execution languages like **Signal**.

It can also serve as a frontend abstraction layer for hardware-integrated agents, AI execution nodes, or any system requiring **explainable intent execution**.

## Status

This repository currently documents the architecture, execution model, and runtime behavior of SapClarify.  
Interpreter implementation and runtime integration are under development.
